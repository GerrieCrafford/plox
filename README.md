# PLOX - A Python Lox interpreter

A Python implementation of the Lox language following Nystrom's excellent book, [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).

## Roadmap

* [x] Better error handling (don't crash the REPL when an error occurs, print multiple errors if there are multiple)

* [x] Block comments
* [x] Comma expressions
* [x] Ternary operator
* [x] String coercion with concatenation operator
* [x] Let REPL print expression value and execute statement
* [ ] Add break statements
* [ ] Add anonymous functions
* [ ] Add static class methods
* [ ] Add user-defined getters and setters
* [ ] Add multiple inheritance
* [ ] Add imports
* [ ] Report multiple errors instead of breaking on first
